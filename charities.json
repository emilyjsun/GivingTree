Neglecting and abusing dogs, cats and wild animals, and treating them as commodities, is still a widely common cultural norm in former Soviet countries. There are hundreds of traveling dolphinaria, animal circuses, petting zoos and no wildlife sanctuary to rescue those animals to.When you find animals in need, there is usually nowhere to take them, no number to call for help, like there is in the western countries. There is no supporting infrastructure and unless you can afford to take the animal to the vet, pay the bills and look for a new home, there is usually nothing you can do, besides just watching them suffer.We are changing the culture where people treat animals as things that are there for them to keep or use as entertainment until it suits them, and to get rid of, when theyve had enough of them, often inhumanely kill or simply abandon.Forgotten Animals does this through:1. Neutering of cats and dogs, reducing the number of unwanted litters and abandonment.2. Making veterinary services available where there are none and helping create and sustain the needed infrastructure3. Educating the population through social ads and humane education4.Lobbying for a legislation change, including drafting a variety of actual law proposals5.Rehabilitating orphaned bear cubs and releasing them back to the wild6. In 2021 we will start building the countrys first real wildlife sanctuary, where we can rescue abused wild animals to and finally start shutting down the industries, that are torturing animals for profit and so-called entertainment.The work we do alleviates and prevents suffering and deaths and improves the lives of animals and people. Instead of merely fighting the consequences, Forgotten Animals targets the root causes by bringing the best practice and expertise from around the world to remote places in need. With deep understanding of the local culture and mentality and by keeping our overheads low, we work efficiently and effectively, where it is needed the most."

And this is the world of Hope Unlimited  organized in 1991 to reclaim and parent the lost children of Brazil.Over the past 32 years, reaching deeply into one life at a time, Hope Unlimited has directly touched the lives of over 27,000 children  including their next generations.

We work with over 100 rescue partners throughout the rural Midwest, South, and Southeast to save well over 5,000 lives every year on approximately 10% of the budget of similarly sized organizations. We are committed to stretching every donated dollar as far as it can go.We drive over 100,000 miles every year to save the lives of homeless pets who are at risk of euthanasia, abandonment, or worse. Our robust transport program was once criticized by industry insiders but is now talked about as the future of rescue. We have always believed that More Is Possible, and we wholeheartedly agree with Orville Wrights statement, If we worked on the assumption that what is accepted as true really is true, then there would be little hope for advance.Wright-Way Rescue operates on a unique model to save lives. Animals come to our Admissions Center located in Southern Illinois where they receive complete medical care before travelling to our main adoption center in Chicago. Our program is founded on strong shelter medicine, and, to that end, we run a Critical Care Center near our Admissions Center that is designed to address highly contagious but treatable diseases such as parvovirus, distemper, and sarcoptic mange. We have a satellite adoption center located at Lambs Farm, a non-profit dedicated to helping adults with disabilities lead happy and productive lives. We also have a small adoption center at our Admissions Center, and we are in the process of developing foster programs in two other states. In addition, we engage thousands of volunteers every year as fosters, dog walkers, cat entertainers, and much needed shelter helpers.To us, animal welfare is foundational to building compassionate communities, and that is our dream.

Lack of spay-neuter laws and large sections of rural land allow for free-roaming animals to reproduce, leading to a surplus of neglected, homeless, and starving puppies and kittens. These animals are then found and brought to local animal shelters, which simply cannot provide the care or homes these pets need in order to survive. Ultimately, they get euthanized for space or for illnesses contracted at the shelter.WTAR rescues these pets by operating a life-saving transport, foster, and adoption program in Northern Virginia. WTAR finds the pets who need us the most by employing a full-time transport coordinator on the ground in Mississippi (WTAR South), with the goal of working directly with these shelters and communities to be a resource before they euthanize for space. Rescued animals are then scheduled and placed on emergency transport with WTAR to Northern Virginia. These transports operate weekly, relieving the shelters and communities from overcrowding and needless euthanasia.  Upon arrival, they undergo an extensive veterinary intake evaluation and then are placed in foster homes until find their forever homes through private Meet & Greets."

We believe local accountability is an essential component of successful rule of law initiatives. For cases arising in foreign nations, we provide local counsel the legal and political support they need to resolve legal and political disputes, locally. We do this, in part, by first working with local counsel to exhaust domestic court options, rather than first advocating in international bodies or tribunals such as the Inter-American Commission for Human Rights, the United Nations Human Rights Council, among others"

A high school diploma enables them to enter the military or work in support positions in medicine or law; attend vocational or trade school and even community college.Our students are unable to attend regular school because of extensive existing trauma and an on-going chaotic lifestyle so our case management program dovetails with our High School Diploma tutoring.Globally, our ZOOM tutoring is teaching English and Math to Child Sex Trafficking Victims living in Christian or Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs).Many of these children are unable to leave the safe refuge where they seek protection because the risk of kidnapping for sex or labor trafficking is REAL.When these children learn English, they can obtain employment in their countrys call centers or tourist industry. With strong math skills and high scores on their nations math test, their own countries will fund their college education and increasing their employment opportunities in IT (Internet Technology).With our innovative programs, we will be able to help another 11,000 at-risk youth in a fraction of the time and cost it took to help the first 11,000.All gifts are spent on domestic programs (America) unless otherwise indicated by the donor."

Sure, the risk of waterborne illnesses such as, Cholera, Salmonella, Giardia, E. Coli, and Typhoid, is mitigatedbut it also positively affects many other aspects of life.Less money spent on medicine and clinic visits, plus less time staying home being sick, less time collecting water or the wood to boil that water, means a significant change to the socioeconomics of a community. Less sick days for children means a higher attendance in school, changing the outcome of their overall education. The list goes on: infant care, feminine hygiene, women empowerment. All of these reasons are a driving force for us, but it is the fundamental belief that everyone deserves access to clean water, as a basic human right, that drives us everyday.Day in and day out we channel that drive as we work on the front lines providing access to clean water through the implementation of portable water filtration systems, the digging and renovating of bore-hole wells, and the construction of rainwater harvesting/storing systems (in places where groundwater is not accessible)."
