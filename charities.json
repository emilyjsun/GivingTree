Neglecting and abusing dogs, cats and wild animals, and treating them as commodities, is still a widely common cultural norm in former Soviet countries. There are hundreds of traveling dolphinaria, animal circuses, petting zoos and no wildlife sanctuary to rescue those animals to.When you find animals in need, there is usually nowhere to take them, no number to call for help, like there is in the western countries. There is no supporting infrastructure and unless you can afford to take the animal to the vet, pay the bills and look for a new home, there is usually nothing you can do, besides just watching them suffer.We are changing the culture where people treat animals as things that are there for them to keep or use as entertainment until it suits them, and to get rid of, when theyve had enough of them, often inhumanely kill or simply abandon.Forgotten Animals does this through:1. Neutering of cats and dogs, reducing the number of unwanted litters and abandonment.2. Making veterinary services available where there are none and helping create and sustain the needed infrastructure3. Educating the population through social ads and humane education4.Lobbying for a legislation change, including drafting a variety of actual law proposals5.Rehabilitating orphaned bear cubs and releasing them back to the wild6. In 2021 we will start building the countrys first real wildlife sanctuary, where we can rescue abused wild animals to and finally start shutting down the industries, that are torturing animals for profit and so-called entertainment.The work we do alleviates and prevents suffering and deaths and improves the lives of animals and people. Instead of merely fighting the consequences, Forgotten Animals targets the root causes by bringing the best practice and expertise from around the world to remote places in need. With deep understanding of the local culture and mentality and by keeping our overheads low, we work efficiently and effectively, where it is needed the most."

Designated a UNESCO World Heritage site with Paris Banks of the Seine, it is one of the most beloved monuments in the world, visited by more than 12 million people every year before the fire.Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization established in 2017. Our original mandate was to support the restoration and preservation of Notre-Dame Cathedral, which had not had major repairs since the mid-1800s.Challenges like pollution, rain, and the inferior quality of the stone used during the 19th century restoration weakened the basic infrastructure of the cathedral and became increasingly critical to address. To halt the decay, in 2017 Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris launched an international fundraising campaign to raise the $135 million needed for the renovation, on top of the $45 million budget committed by the French Government.In the aftermath of the devastating fire on April 15, 2019, our mission changed to rebuild, restore and preserve Notre-Dame Cathedral.Friends of Notre-Dame de Paris is the official public charity leading the international fundraising efforts to rebuild and restore Notre-Dame Cathedral."

And this is the world of Hope Unlimited  organized in 1991 to reclaim and parent the lost children of Brazil.Over the past 32 years, reaching deeply into one life at a time, Hope Unlimited has directly touched the lives of over 27,000 children  including their next generations.

The problem of pet overpopulation in Rural America is dire and virtually undocumented, and we believe that helping these remote communities is critical to the national No-Kill movement. We work with over 100 rescue partners throughout the rural Midwest, South, and Southeast to save well over 5,000 lives every year on approximately 10% of the budget of similarly sized organizations. We are committed to stretching every donated dollar as far as it can go.We drive over 100,000 miles every year to save the lives of homeless pets who are at risk of euthanasia, abandonment, or worse. Our robust transport program was once criticized by industry insiders but is now talked about as the future of rescue. We have always believed that More Is Possible, and we wholeheartedly agree with Orville Wrights statement, If we worked on the assumption that what is accepted as true really is true, then there would be little hope for advance.Wright-Way Rescue operates on a unique model to save lives. Animals come to our Admissions Center located in Southern Illinois where they receive complete medical care before travelling to our main adoption center in Chicago. Our program is founded on strong shelter medicine, and, to that end, we run a Critical Care Center near our Admissions Center that is designed to address highly contagious but treatable diseases such as parvovirus, distemper, and sarcoptic mange. We have a satellite adoption center located at Lambs Farm, a non-profit dedicated to helping adults with disabilities lead happy and productive lives. We also have a small adoption center at our Admissions Center, and we are in the process of developing foster programs in two other states. In addition, we engage thousands of volunteers every year as fosters, dog walkers, cat entertainers, and much needed shelter helpers.To us, animal welfare is foundational to building compassionate communities, and that is our dream.

Lack of spay-neuter laws and large sections of rural land allow for free-roaming animals to reproduce, leading to a surplus of neglected, homeless, and starving puppies and kittens. These animals are then found and brought to local animal shelters, which simply cannot provide the care or homes these pets need in order to survive. Ultimately, they get euthanized for space or for illnesses contracted at the shelter.WTAR rescues these pets by operating a life-saving transport, foster, and adoption program in Northern Virginia. WTAR finds the pets who need us the most by employing a full-time transport coordinator on the ground in Mississippi (WTAR South), with the goal of working directly with these shelters and communities to be a resource before they euthanize for space. Rescued animals are then scheduled and placed on emergency transport with WTAR to Northern Virginia. These transports operate weekly, relieving the shelters and communities from overcrowding and needless euthanasia.  Upon arrival, they undergo an extensive veterinary intake evaluation and then are placed in foster homes until find their forever homes through private Meet & Greets."

We rescue young people from pimps, help with medical services, public health insurance, social security/disability benefits, maternity housing, drug program placement, domestic violence, transportation, mental health services, psychiatric evaluations, or access to psychotropic medications. We advocate with the courts, social workers, and probation officers. We help with resumes, job placement, access to vocational or trade schools or community colleges, applications for FAFSA (federally funded financial aid)  we are ready and willing to help.Our FREE one-on-one tutoring program through ZOOM tutors sex trafficking victims for the high school diploma  the first step in escaping the streets. A high school diploma enables them to enter the military or work in support positions in medicine or law; attend vocational or trade school and even community college.Our students are unable to attend regular school because of extensive existing trauma and an on-going chaotic lifestyle so our case management program dovetails with our High School Diploma tutoring.Globally, our ZOOM tutoring is teaching English and Math to Child Sex Trafficking Victims living in Christian or Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs).Many of these children are unable to leave the safe refuge where they seek protection because the risk of kidnapping for sex or labor trafficking is REAL.When these children learn English, they can obtain employment in their countrys call centers or tourist industry. With strong math skills and high scores on their nations math test, their own countries will fund their college education and increasing their employment opportunities in IT (Internet Technology).With our innovative programs, we will be able to help another 11,000 at-risk youth in a fraction of the time and cost it took to help the first 11,000.All gifts are spent on domestic programs (America) unless otherwise indicated by the donor."
